<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
    Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
    <br>I have learned about Git and GitHub in previous courses and i am confortable using 
    <br>these two tools.
    <br>
    <br> This si the first time i heard about Markdown and Github Pages. Though. i have unknowingly 
    <br> use Markdown in  different forums/github to style read.me files<br>
    <br> Have you ever created websites before?
    <br>
    <br> Yes, I did. I played around with HTML and CSS a few years ago. It was simple site to
    <br> display some information about the person. 
    <br>
    <br>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
    <br>
    <br> I do not have much experience with web development expect, from web application coruse where 
    <br> we used RESTful API and Java RMI to build a web applications. We also programmed on a lower
    <br> layer with TCP/UDP protocols and how to create a server from scratch using these protocols.
    <br> I have also gained good knowledge about proxy servers and its role in the web traffic control
    <br> and server optimizations. 
    <br>
    <br> What is your TIL for this course section?
    <br>
    <br> I have learned what Markdown is and how can we set up own web page using GitHub Pages.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
    <br>
    <br> I have some experience with building a simple website using HTML and CSS.
    <br> On the other hand, I have no experience with JavaScript language. 
    <br>
    <br>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
    <br>
    <br> We use HTML to build/display content on the website, CSS is used to style 
    <br> the website and make it more apealing. JavaScrip is used to make site more
    <br> interactive and dynamic. JS can be also used on server side and web 
    <br> applications.    
    <br>
    <br>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
    <br>
    <br> When we brows the internet, a web browser acts as a client that sends
    <br> HTTP requsts and receives HTTP response to/from web server. Web server
    <br> receives request, process it and sends back a respond to a client/web 
    <br> browser.
    <br>
    <br>What is your TIL for this course section?

    <br> I have learnt how to set up my own GitHub page and how to
    <br> style it using HTMP and CSS

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
    <p>No, I have never coded in JavaScript at all before</p>
    Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
   <p>I am only familiar with Java very well, which is mostly OOP language. On the other hand 
       JavaScript is functional language and not so strictly typed language like java.
   </p>
    Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
 <p>
     I am aiming for grade 5, I have solved all the exercises by reading JS/HTML/CSS
     documentation and searching through coding forums.
 </p>
    What is your TIL for this course section?
<p>
    I enjoyed doing the exercise, because I learned a lot about JavaScript/HTML/CSS, how to
    use asynchronous requests, acessing elements in DOM tree and using event handlers.
